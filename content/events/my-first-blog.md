Dr David Bernhard will be delivering an introduction to git talk. Git is a crucial piece of software when working on collaborative codebases. This talk is open to all CSS members who would be interested in learning Git - there is no previous experience or knowledge required.

We will be using git extensively as part of this project, so it is very important that you understand its fundamentals.
